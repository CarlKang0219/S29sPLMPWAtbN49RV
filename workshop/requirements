1.
	A Node has only one Transmitter and Receiver.
1.1
	A Transmitter or Receiver may have more than one Antennas.
2. 
	An Antenna transmit Time-domain Signal samples into Channel that User specified.
3. 
	The transmitted signal is calcuated and processed by Blocks.
4. 
	Each Block is responsible of a certain function such as generating binary data, 
	Encoding, IFFT and etc.
5. 
	Every Block is configured by Users before any signal is processed.
6. 
	Every Block has input interfaces and output interfaces, and Blocks are connected
	by Users when a specific kind of Node is created.
7. 
	The Channel is shared by all Nodes with no exception.
8.
	An antenna received Time-domain signals from Channel and pass it to Receiver.
9.
	Signals is passed and processed by Blocks or Channel
