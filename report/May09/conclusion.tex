\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}
It is positive that SIC can enhance user fairness for users in
relatively bad channel condition.
Further experiment is done to prove that scheduling is
necessary to reach better performance gain.
It's as expected that scheduling users in great difference of path
loss may reach our objective.
