\label{future_work}
First of all,
in practice the base station cannot get the position information of users,
thus the algorithm to decide SIC pairs in single RB has to be designed 
depends on the channel feedback.
Second, the simulation parameter settings should set as the same as 3GPP
specification's regulation to evaluate the performance.
The future simulation will refer to report in series 36.
Third,
The scheduling algorithm in the report is a simple greedy one.
To exploit SIC in scheduling, a full search should be done for reference.
Fourth,
The unit test of FDE module (equalizer) is done, should replace the old
one.
The channel is static 3-taps TDL, a time-vary version should be build.

Finally,
Project of uplink SISO-SIC simulation launches right after the the downlink
part is finished.
