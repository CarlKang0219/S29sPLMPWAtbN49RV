\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}
We have built a simulation model for NOMA based on SIC that
takes into consideration MCS selection, error propagation, and
power allocation into consideration.
The simulation model serves as the basis for our preliminary
investigation at the MAC layer for two-user pairing and scheduling
in each OFDM resource block.
Our preliminary results have substantiated the potentials of NOMA
in the next-generation communication system and paved the
ground for continuing investigation of various MAC layer research
issues in the future.
