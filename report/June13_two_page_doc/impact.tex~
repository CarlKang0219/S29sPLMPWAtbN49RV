\section{Impact}
\label{sec_impact}
We have found that a 20\% performance gain in the (weighted) sum
rate can be achieved when the paired users have a path-loss ratio
of 10. The performance gain increases as the difference in the
channel condition (path loss) keeps increasing.
Best MCS for two-user NOMA based on the obtained MCS/BER model 
for two-user NOMA (right figure), the proposed scheduling algorithm 
can pair users with 91.67\% optimality (for a 12-user downlink scenario)
without incurring the complexity needed in exhaustive search.
