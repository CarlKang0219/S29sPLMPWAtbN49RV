\section{Main achievement}
\label{sec_main_achievement}
We have built a physical-layer simulation platform for single-
antenna NOMA with consideration of modulation, channel coding,
and multipath channels based on SIC.
We have obtained the desired MCS/BER model for two-user
NOMA in the two-stage decoding scheme for further investigation
on MCS selection, power allocation, and user pairing at the MAC
layer.
We have investigated a simple scheduling algorithm for pairing
users in each OFDM resource block such that the BERs of all
users can satisfy the desired constraint (through proper MCS
selection) while achieving performance gain in the sum rate.
