\section{End goals}
\label{sec_end_goals}
Based on the NOMA simulation model and the two-user
scheduling algorithm that we have completed so far, our goal in
the future is to explore more generic problems and algorithms
for resource allocation, scheduling, and power control at the
MAC layer for optimizing the performance of NOMA under the
desirable computation complexity and communication overheads.
The simulation model for single-antenna NOMA will be extended to
MIMO such that clustered-based resource allocation and
scheduling can be investigated in the future.
