\section{Risk limitation and assumptions}
\label{sec_risk_limit}
The base station transmit multiplexed signal from two independent sources.
The receiver is aware of number of multiplexed user data and thus no further
detection is needed to identify the depth of decoding order.
Full channel state condition is assume in the simulation, no channel estimation
or receiver manufacture defect is taken into consideration.
As an investigation of the limitation of NOMA with SIC, the BS can only transmit
signals of two sources utmost.
