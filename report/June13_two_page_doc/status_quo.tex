\section{Status quo}
\label{sec_status_quo}

Briefly, by the previous effort in literature survey, we summarize related 
work as follows.
Some studies investigate non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) by theoretical 
models, which are extended from shannon capacity model.
Based on theoretical models, the rule that the optimal order for SIC decoding 
is same as the increasing order of $\frac{|h|^2}{N}$. 
A NOMA/Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) scheme is proposed to achieve 
further capacity gain.
Throughput balance of the cell-edge and interior users by using SIC in the 
cellular downlink.

Other works show SIC performance of simulations with respect to physical layer 
design has significant diffrence compared to the theoretical model.
To proceed with research in MAC-layer, a working simulation model based on
existing techniques are built to capture the practical performace trad-off
in NOMA.
