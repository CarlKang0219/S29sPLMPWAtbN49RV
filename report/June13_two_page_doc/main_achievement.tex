\section{Main achievement}
\label{sec_main_achievement}
We have built a physical-layer simulation platform for single-
antenna NOMA with consideration of modulation, channel coding,
and multipath channels based on SIC.
We have obtained the desired MCS/BER model for two-user
NOMA in the two-stage decoding scheme.
We have investigated a simple scheduling algorithm for pairing
users in each OFDM resource block such that the BERs of all
users can satisfy the desired constraint.
