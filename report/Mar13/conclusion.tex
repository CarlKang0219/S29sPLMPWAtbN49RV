\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}
We've surveyed models for NOMA with SIC in OFDM system form the
prior work which covers the design of SIC receiver, single antenna 
SIC Capacity model, MIMO-SIC downlilnk model and topics subject to
resource allocation and scheduling considering user fairness in NOMA with SIC.
However, according to the scope of project purposed, there are
some part remains unclear. For example, inter-cell interference
is neglected, and we have not found sufficient literature about
uplink MIMO-SIC model and coordinate muti-point (COMP) access
model.
