\subsection{MIMO SIC}
For system beyond LTE-Advanced in the future, successive
interference canceller (SIC) in the cellular multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) is an important issue.

We consider investigation of NOMA with SIC in the cellular MIMO system.
The idea is to implement SIC to signals within
a single beam controlled by the beamforming (precoding) matrix.
In \cite{Non-orthogonal_Access_with_Random_Beamforming_and_Intra-beam_SIC_for_Cellular_MIMO_Downlink},
the authors propose intra-beam superposition coding of a multiuser signal at
the transmitter and the spatial filtering of inter-beam
interference followed by the intra-beam SIC at the user terminal
receiver. The intra-beam SIC cancels out the inter-user
interference within a beam.
According to \cite{Non-orthogonal_Access_with_Random_Beamforming_and_Intra-beam_SIC_for_Cellular_MIMO_Downlink},
the channel after the spatial filtering is a degraded SISO
channel, and the equivalent normalized channel gain of user
$k$ scheduled in frequency block $b$ on beam $i$
can be formulated as follows:

%ufb->kbi
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gain_mimo_mmse_rcvr}
\begin{split}
&g_{k,b,i}= \\
&\frac{|\mathbf{v}^H_{k,b,i} \mathbf{H}_{k,b} \mathbf{m}_{b,i}|^2}{\underset{i'\in I, i'\neq i}{\sum} P_{i'}|\mathbf{v}^H_{k,b,i} \mathbf{H}_{k,b} \mathbf{m}_{b,i'}|^2 + \mathbf{v}^{H}_{k,b,i} E[\mathbf{w}_{k,b} \mathbf{w}^{H}_{k,b}] \mathbf{v}_{k,b,i}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In equation~\ref{eq:gain_mimo_mmse_rcvr}, 
$\mathbf{v}_{k,b,i}$ denotes the spacial filter vector, in \cite{Non-orthogonal_Access_with_Random_Beamforming_and_Intra-beam_SIC_for_Cellular_MIMO_Downlink},
it is is calculated based on the minimum mean squared error
(MMSE) criteria.
$\mathbf{H}_{k,b}$ denotes the N $\times$ M-dimensional channel matrix between
the base station and user $k$ at frequency block $b$.
$\mathbf{m}_{b,i}$ denotes the transmitter beamforming vector.
$\mathbf{w}_{k,b}$ denotes the receiver noise plus inter-cell interference
vector at frequency block $b$,
and $P_{i}$ is the transmission power of beam $i$.
Therefore, we can apply intra-beam SIC to received signal in the
same way by equation~\ref{eq_sic_shannon}.
