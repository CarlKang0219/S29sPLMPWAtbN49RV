\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}
We've surveyed models for NOMA with SIC in OFDM system form the
prior work. However, according to the scope of project, there are
some part remains unclear. For example, inter-cell interference
is neglected, and we have not found sufficient literature about
uplink MIMO-SIC model and coordinate muti-point (COMP) access
model.
