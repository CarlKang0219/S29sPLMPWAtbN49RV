The report shows progress of literature survey on the physical and
MAC layer techniques for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).
The content of the report focus on the technique of
successive interference cancellation (SIC) in OFDM
system. In section~\ref{sec_phy} shows different capacity 
model of SIC and in section~\ref{sec_mac} shows
scheduling problems in different scenarios.
